// As you complete each challenge, RUN THE CODE to ensure it works. You can do this by
// running `node <filepath>`. If you are in this directory, you'd run `node for.js`.
  
// Challenge 1
// Use a for statement to log to the console all even numbers between 25 and 75.
```
for (var i = 26; i <= 74; i+=2) {
  console.log(i)
}
```

// Challenge 2
// Use a for statement to log to the console a complete sentence stating the weather using the Array below:
//var weather_options = ["sunny", "snowy", "freezing", "partly cloudy", "drizzly"]
```
var weather_options = ["sunny", "snowy", "freezing", "partly cloudy", "drizzly"]

for(var i = 0; i < weather_options.length; i++){
  console.log("Weather can be:" + weather_options [i])
}
```

// Challenge 3
// Use a for statement to log to the console only the words that are exactly 3 characters in length
var words = ["car", "bike", "bus", "van", "scooter", "truck", "rv"]
```
var words = ["car", "bike", "bus", "van", "scooter", "truck", "rv"]
console.log(words.slice (3, 4), words.slice (0, 1), words.slice (2, 3))
for(i=0;i<= (words.slice (3, 4), words.slice (0, 1), words.slice (2, 3); i++){
console.log(i)
 }
 ```
