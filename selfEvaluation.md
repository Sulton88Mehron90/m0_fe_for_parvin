# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `for` statement? *not confident. need to practice and study.*
- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle? *i did have both productive and unproductive struggle.*
- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?  *I need to create environment to be able to focus and have time to study. I will have it when i go back to Colorado in January 1, 2023.*
- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need? *Google, ask my teachers and classmates.*
