# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `for` statement? *I am confident just need more practice.*
- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle? * I straggle a little with not having enough time before the due time of the submission. However I wake up early and get ready for next session. that seems working well and I am managing time spend on matirials.*
- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?  *I will continue practicing the content we covered in Mod 0. I would definitely will complet the Learn JavaScript course from codecademy as a resource for continued practice. I would also be using my codewars account and practicing using your new JavaScript skills to solve challenges. *
- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need? *Google, ask my teachers and classmates.I hope I can still time to time contact Kaitlyn if i am absolytley stuck. She has been an amazing instractor.*
